Level 100 plans --


(Stat) Magic Shield 

Max magic points & wisdom points fused to
partially protect the  user from magic shots.


(New Feature) Special Attack

Build up power points by getting damaged, 
when the power points are at max. Power 
points max out at 4000 damage (doesn't
count armor)

Only special abilities have a special
attack. Special attacks will deal fixed
amounts if you are equipping a special
item (likely to be all uts).

Certain items will have better abilities,
and so will require more health before
activation.


Stat modification

Make stats a float value so you can
increase them in decimal values ~~
Balance character stat increase per
level per character.
